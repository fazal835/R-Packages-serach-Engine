Title,Description

abn: Modelling Multivariate Data with Additive Bayesian Networks,"Bayesian network analysis is a form of probabilistic graphical models which derives from empirical data a directed acyclic graph, DAG, describing the dependency structure between random variables. An additive Bayesian network model consists of a form of a DAG where each node comprises a generalized linear model, GLM. Additive Bayesian network models are equivalent to Bayesian multivariate regression using graphical modelling, they generalises the usual multivariable regression, GLM, to multiple dependent variables. 'abn' provides routines to help determine optimal Bayesian network models for a given data set, where these models are used to identify statistical dependencies in messy, complex data. The additive formulation of these models is equivalent to multivariate generalised linear modelling (including mixed models with iid random effects). The usual term to describe this model selection process is structure discovery. The core functionality is concerned with model selection - determining the most robust empirical model of data from interdependent variables. Laplace approximations are used to estimate goodness of fit metrics and model parameters, and wrappers are also included to the INLA package which can be obtained from <http://www.r-inla.org>. A comprehensive set of documented case studies, numerical accuracy/quality assurance exercises, and additional documentation are available from the 'abn' website."
AdMit: Adaptive Mixture of Student-t Distributions,Provides functions to perform the fitting of an adaptive mixture of Student-t distributions to a target density through its kernel function as described in Ardia et al. (2009) <doi:10.18637/jss.v029.i03>. The mixture approximation can then be used as the importance density in importance sampling or as the candidate density in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to obtain quantities of interest for the target density itself.

BaBooN: Bayesian Bootstrap Predictive Mean Matching - Multiple and Single Imputation for Discrete Data,"Included are two variants of Bayesian Bootstrap Predictive Mean Matching to multiply impute missing data. The first variant is a variable-by-variable imputation combining sequential regression and Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) that has been extended for unordered categorical data. The Bayesian Bootstrap allows for generating approximately proper multiple imputations. The second variant is also based on PMM, but the focus is on imputing several variables at the same time. The suggestion is to use this variant, if the missing-data pattern resembles a data fusion situation, or any other missing-by-design pattern, where several variables have identical missing-data patterns. Both variants can be run as 'single imputation' versions, in case the analysis objective is of a purely descriptive nature."

The data are modeled with a hierarchical Bayesian models using heavy-tailed t distributions as priors. When a large number of features are available, one may like to select only a subset of features to use, typically those features strongly correlated with the response in training cases. Such a feature selection procedure is however invalid since the relationship between the response and the features has be exaggerated by feature selection. This package provides a way to avoid this bias and yield better-calibrated predictions for future cases when one uses F-statistic to select features."

'NIMBLE' extends the 'BUGS'/'JAGS' language by making it extensible: New distributions and functions can be added, including as calls to external compiled code. Although most people think of MCMC as the main goal of the 'BUGS'/'JAGS' language for writing models, one can use 'NIMBLE' for writing arbitrary other kinds of model-generic algorithms as well.
